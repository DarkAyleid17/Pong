## Building

Make sure you have a C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.).

```sh
g++ -std=c++98 -o pongpp main.cpp
on Windows systems use windows.cpp instead off main.cpp
```

On classic systems, use the native C++ compiler.

## How to Play

- **Player 1:** <kbd>W</kbd> / <kbd>S</kbd>
- **Player 2:** <kbd>↑</kbd> / <kbd>↓</kbd>
- **Goal:** Bounce the ball back, score points, and don't let it pass your paddle!
